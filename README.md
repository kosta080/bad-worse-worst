Hi Unity Developers!
 
We all know that there are bad practices in unity but how bad are they...
I created this project to measure that.

From Appending strings to removing items form the middle of a List, to using GetComponent 
i tried to cover all the common bad practices that i know 
and compare them to the good alternatives 
Spoiler - GetComponent is not so bad

This Repository is public i invite you to suggest what tests i should add, 
contribute to the repository, extend my tests, 
tell me that i did it all wrong and have fun with it 

TBD 
Rendering, phisics
