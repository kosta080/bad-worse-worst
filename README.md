Hi Unity Developers!
 
We all know that there are bad practices in unity but how bad are they...
I created this project to measure that.

From Appending strings to removing items form the middle of a List, to using GetComponent 
i tried to cover all the common bad practices that i know 
and compare them to the good alternatives 
Spoiler - GetComponent is not so bad

This Repository is public i invite you to suggest what tests i should add, 
contribute to the repository, extend my tests, 
tell me that i did it all wrong and have fun with it 

TBD 
Rendering, phisics

Relayability and Precision of Stopwatch: 
While Stopwatch is precise, the exact moment it starts and stops around operations like Instantiate 
and Destroy might slightly differ between runs due to execution context switching in the operating system.
